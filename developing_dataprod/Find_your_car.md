Data used in the app (mtcars)
========================================================
Here we used the dataset mtcars available in R. A glimpse of the data is as below:

```
                   mpg cyl disp  hp am
Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110  1
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110  1
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93  1
Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110  0
Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175  0
Valiant           18.1   6  225 105  0
```

Details about the data:
========================================================
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).

Following are few important fields:

- mpg	    Miles/(US) gallon
- cyl	    Number of cylinders
- disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
- hp	    Gross horsepower
- am	    Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
Link and How to use it:
=======================================================
The link to use the application is  https://bmaharathi.shinyapps.io/Find_your_car/ 

It has two sections:
- You can put the filter criteria to find the qualifyings cars.
- plot the comparison plot for the selected parameters with mpg.
